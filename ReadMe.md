### Hi, I am Paras Godhani  

Machine Learning Engineer building production-grade AI systems from data to deployment.  
I specialize in taking ML models from notebooks to production APIs, with focus on system reliability, scalability, and real-world performance. My work spans the full ML lifecycle: from SQL-based data extraction and feature engineering to model training, containerized deployment, and operational monitoring.  

### 🎯 What I Build  
End-to-End ML Systems — Not just models, but complete pipelines including data ingestion, feature stores, model serving APIs, monitoring, and CI/CD automation.  
LLM-Powered Applications — Production RAG systems, multi-document chatbots, and LLM-based extraction pipelines with attention to retrieval quality, latency budgets, and failure handling.  
Computer Vision Pipelines — CNN-based classifiers deployed via Flask/FastAPI with Docker containerization and cloud infrastructure on AWS.  
Data Platforms — SQL-driven analytics, feature engineering workflows, and automated reporting systems using Python, Pandas, and visualization tools.
