## Hi, I'm Paras Godhani👋
Aspiring Data scientist with practical experience developing data-driven solutions in machine learning and applied AI based systems. Demand forecasting, deep learning, RAG-based chatbots, and ensemble prediction systems are just a few of the end-to-end projects I've worked on, deploying them in cloud and containerized environments. I take ownership of the process from raw data to actual impact, and I do more than just create models and  I also translate them into decisions that stakeholders can implement.

Programming: Python, C++, SQL  
Tools & Technologies: Git/GitHub, Flask, FastAPI, Tableau, MySQL, MLflow, Docker, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda)  
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Transformers, Hugging Face, LangChain, LangGraph  
Techniques & Algorithms: Machine Learning, Supervised & Unsupervised Learning, Time Series Analysis, Dimensionality Reduction, Deep Learning, LSTM, NLP, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), MLOps  
Soft Skills: Analytical Thinking, Critical Thinking, Continuous Improvement, Creativity, Attention to Detail, Adaptability, Team Building, Ownership
